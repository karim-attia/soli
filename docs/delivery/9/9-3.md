## Requirements
- Choose an Expo-compatible storage library (e.g., `expo-secure-store` or `expo-storage`).
- Save settings whenever they change and hydrate them during app launch.
- Handle migration/defaults for first-run devices gracefully.

## Implementation Plan
1. Evaluate storage libraries and select one that meets performance and availability needs.
2. Implement persistence in the settings context created in Task 9-2.
3. Add hydration logic with loading states to avoid UI flicker on boot.
4. Write unit/integration tests covering serialization/deserialization.
5. Ensure settings changes resolve before honoring them in gameplay components.

## Test Plan
- Manual: Toggle settings, restart the app, and verify values persist.
- `yarn test --watch=false` for persistence helpers.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`.

## Verification
- Manual persistence checks on simulator and web.
- `yarn test --watch=false`.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`.

## Files Modified
- `package.json`
- `app/settings.tsx`
- `src/state/settings.ts`
