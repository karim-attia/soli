## Requirements
- Add a Settings option to the burger/drawer menu that navigates to a new screen.
- Implement base layout components (section headers, toggle rows) following Tamagui guidelines.
- Ensure screen is responsive on phone and tablet form factors.

## Implementation Plan
1. Update navigation configuration to include a `settings` route accessible from the burger menu.
2. Build a Tamagui screen component with grouped sections for animations and appearance.
3. Add placeholder toggles for global animation, per-animation toggles, and dark mode options (wired in later tasks).
4. Validate navigation transitions and header titles.
5. Write or update documentation to reference new screen location.

## Test Plan
- Manual: Open the burger menu and navigate to Settings, ensuring layout renders correctly.
- Manual: Check responsiveness by rotating simulator or resizing browser.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`.

## Verification
- Manual: Opened the drawer menu and confirmed navigation to Settings and Hello screens on iOS simulator and web.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`.
- `yarn test --watchAll=false`.

## Files Modified
- `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`
