## Requirements
- Show a textual label in the bottom-right corner of the Klondike board whenever a celebration is active and developer mode is enabled.
- Format the label to include the celebration’s numeric identifier (1-based) and human-readable name sourced from the metadata module.
- Ensure the overlay respects safe-area padding, remains readable on both felt backgrounds, and disappears once the celebration ends or developer mode is disabled.

## Implementation Plan
1. Import the celebration metadata helper from the new module created in Task 18-1.
2. Derive the label text from `celebrationState.modeId` and memoize it while the celebration remains active.
3. Render an absolutely positioned Tamagui stack/text in the bottom-right corner of the board container, gated by `developerModeEnabled` and `celebrationState`.
4. Apply styling (background blur/opacity, padding, font size) aligned with existing debug UI patterns to keep the overlay unobtrusive yet legible.

## Test Plan
- Enable developer mode, trigger a win, and confirm the overlay appears with the expected text.
- Disable developer mode (or end the celebration) and verify the overlay disappears immediately.
- Test on both light and dark system themes to confirm readability.

## Verification
- Manual win sequence under developer mode with visual confirmation of the overlay behavior.

## Files Modified
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
