# [24-3] Author feature graphic concept variants

[Back to task list](../tasks.md)

## Description
Develop a marketing-ready concept brief for the Google Play feature graphic. The brief should outline inspiration sources, visual direction, copy strategy, safe-area guardrails, and at least two layout variants to guide implementation.

## Requirements
- Summarize relevant Google Play promotional guidelines and safe-area expectations with citations.
- Research at least two existing feature-graphic examples or best-practice write-ups to inspire the aesthetic direction.
- Propose multiple layout variants (minimum two) describing component usage, typography, and card arrangements.
- Define visual guardrails that keep future updates within the safe area and maintain marketing polish.

## Implementation Plan
1. Review official Google Play promotional content guidelines and recent industry breakdowns for feature-graphic expectations.
2. Capture key insights, citing primary sources (Google PDF, App marketing analyses, etc.), and highlight implications for Soli.
3. Outline multiple layout variants that reuse in-app components (`CardVisual`, `StatisticsHud`, etc.) and specify copy hierarchy, colour palette, and focal zones.
4. Document safe-area guard strategies, including code-level guardrails (constants, debug overlays) and process notes (review checklist).
5. Circulate the concept brief within the codebase for reference before updating the React composition.

## Research Notes
- **Safe area enforcement** – Google’s promotional content deck illustrates a “featured placement frame” that requires designers to keep critical content within a central frame; Google reiterates 1024×500 JPG/PNG specs and discourages edge-heavy layouts.<br>

- **ASO best practices** – AppRadar’s feature-graphic guide stresses bold focal imagery, minimal copy, and centered composition so store UI chrome never crops key beats.<br>

- **Historical example breakdown** – Space Ape Games documents how their “Rival Kingdoms” feature graphic used large character art, soft gradients, and central alignment while leaving a 15% bleed, reinforcing the same safe-area ratios we captured in Task 24-1.<br>

## Concept Direction
### Core Pillars
- **Soli positioning** – Calm, premium solitaire with “no ads”, solvable shuffles, and timeline undo. Visual tone should feel curated, not stock.
- **Hero moment** – Emphasize the tableau motion and timeline tooling rather than generic card fan art.
- **Safe-area discipline** – Maintain ≥15% padding on all edges; primary callouts sit within ~870×350 center zone.

### Variant A – “Calm Tabletop Hero”
- **Composition**: Felt background gradient, elevated card cluster (tableau arcs + foundations), subtle drop shadows, and a right-hand info column.
- **Components**: `CardVisual` for curated tableau, `StatisticsHud` mini-card highlighting “Moves: 0 / Time: 00:00” to nod at telemetry, `SelectionHint` ghost arrow showing undo time travel.
- **Copy stack**: `Soli` logotype (Tamagui `Display`), tagline “Calm solitaire. Every shuffle solvable.” followed by bullet icons for the three benefits.
- **Accents**: Soft glow behind icon, diagonal felt texture courtesy of `FeltBackground`, and a thin safe-area outline toggle for QA.

### Variant B – “Timeline Spotlight”
- **Composition**: Left column hosts vertical timeline with three `UndoScrubber` snapshots (past, present, future). Right side displays large, angled card fan with animation motion trails drawn via layered `CardVisual` duplicates.
- **Components**: `UndoScrubber` (static, disabled), `StatisticsHud` condensed pill, `CardVisual` trio overlaying to imply motion.
- **Copy stack**: Headline “Time-travel through every deal” with sub copy highlighting the benefit list; CTA-styled badge “Free • No ads”.
- **Colour**: Deeper emerald background with gold accent lines to differentiate from in-game felt while staying recognizable.

### Variant C – “Foundation Triumph” (bonus for localization)
- **Composition**: Central diamond arrangement of foundation piles with a celebratory confetti burst, plus app icon anchored bottom-left.
- **Components**: `CardVisual`, `CelebrationDebugBadge` repurposed as a label showing “Win streak unlocked”, optional `SelectionHint` pointing to icon.
- **Usage**: Secondary asset for seasonal promotions; shares same safe-area scaffolding.

## Guardrails & Follow-up
- Introduce `FEATURE_SAFE_MARGIN_RATIO` constant with comments referencing Task 24-1 to discourage casual edits.
- Add optional debug overlay (toggled via boolean) rendering the safe frame as a dashed outline for QA screenshots.
- Document a `CheckList` in code comments: verify copy strings, confirm icon resolution, snapshot variant toggles, ensure benefit order stays consistent.
- Encourage designers to capture screenshots via `/feature-graphic?variant={a|b|c}` query (expose variant picker in UI).

## Test Plan
- Peer-review concept doc for clarity and completeness.
- Validate cited links remain accessible.
- Ensure implementation team confirms variant feasibility before coding.

## Verification
- Concept brief shared with stakeholders (user) for approval prior to UI refresh.
