## Requirements
- Summarize relevant Google Play promotional guidelines and safe-area expectations with citations.
- Research at least two existing feature-graphic examples or best-practice write-ups to inspire the aesthetic direction.
- Propose multiple layout variants (minimum two) describing component usage, typography, and card arrangements.
- Define visual guardrails that keep future updates within the safe area and maintain marketing polish.

## Implementation Plan
1. Review official Google Play promotional content guidelines and recent industry breakdowns for feature-graphic expectations.
2. Capture key insights, citing primary sources (Google PDF, App marketing analyses, etc.), and highlight implications for Soli.
3. Outline multiple layout variants that reuse in-app components (`CardVisual`, `StatisticsHud`, etc.) and specify copy hierarchy, colour palette, and focal zones.
4. Document safe-area guard strategies, including code-level guardrails (constants, debug overlays) and process notes (review checklist).
5. Circulate the concept brief within the codebase for reference before updating the React composition.

## Research Notes
- **Safe area enforcement** – Google’s promotional content deck illustrates a “featured placement frame” that requires designers to keep critical content within a central frame; Google reiterates 1024×500 JPG/PNG specs and discourages edge-heavy layouts.<br>

- **ASO best practices** – AppRadar’s feature-graphic guide stresses bold focal imagery, minimal copy, and centered composition so store UI chrome never crops key beats.<br>

- **Historical example breakdown** – Space Ape Games documents how their “Rival Kingdoms” feature graphic used large character art, soft gradients, and central alignment while leaving a 15% bleed, reinforcing the same safe-area ratios we captured in Task 24-1.<br>

## Concept Direction
### Core Pillars
- **Soli positioning** – Calm, premium solitaire with “no ads”, solvable shuffles, and timeline undo. Visual tone should feel curated, not stock.
- **Hero moment** – Emphasize the tableau motion and timeline tooling rather than generic card fan art.
- **Safe-area discipline** – Maintain ≥15% padding on all edges; primary callouts sit within ~870×350 center zone.

### Variant A – “Calm Tabletop”
- **Composition**: Felt background gradient, elevated card cluster (tableau arcs + foundations), subtle drop shadows, and a right-hand info column.
- **Components**: `CardVisual` tableau columns, curated waste fan, foundation row, and the marketing copy stack with icon badge plus `StatisticsHud` footer.
- **Copy stack**: Headline “Soli”, subtitle reinforcing calm solitaire, followed by the three benefit bullets.
- **Accents**: Soft glow behind the icon badge, diagonal felt texture courtesy of `FeltBackground`, and drop shadows that keep depth while staying inside the safe frame.

### Variant B – “Timeline Spotlight”
- **Composition**: Left column hosts a vertical undo timeline with three stacked cards; the right side fans highlighted moves with a CTA pill reinforcing “Free • No ads”.
- **Components**: `CardVisual` trio for motion trails, vertical timeline bar, and the stats footer.
- **Copy stack**: Headline “Time-travel through every deal” with supporting copy about solvable shuffles and the timeline undo feature.
- **Colour**: Deeper emerald panel overlay with gold/teal accents to separate the hero vignette from the copy column.

### Variant C – “Foundation Triumph”
- **Composition**: Central diamond arrangement of foundation piles with the celebration badge anchored nearby.
- **Components**: `CardVisual` diamond, `CelebrationDebugBadge` relabelled for Ribbon Cascade, and the standard marketing column.
- **Usage**: Secondary asset for win-state messaging and seasonal celebrations.

### Variant D – “Solvable Path Spotlight”
- **Composition**: Dashed runway that carries alternating suit cards toward an ace foundation, visually describing the deterministic path.
- **Components**: `CardVisual` path cards, dashed guardrail, and a “Guaranteed solvable path” chip.
- **Copy stack**: Emphasises calm solvable play while reiterating the core benefits.

### Variant E – “HUD Insights”
- **Composition**: Hero panel dominated by `StatisticsHud` rows with a layered tableau stack beneath to showcase tracking at a glance.
- **Components**: `StatisticsHud`, short tableau stack, and marketing copy tuned for streak hunters.
- **Usage**: Ideal for changelog updates or ASO experiments targeting competitive players.

### Variant F – "Icon Pulse"
- **Composition**: Brand-first lockup with a ring of suits orbiting the Soli app icon, backed by a subtle halo.
- **Components**: `CardVisual` ring, icon badge, and copy that speaks to recognisable, ad-free solitaire.
- **Usage**: Rotational asset for paid placements or seasonal brand pushes.

## Simplified Concept (2025-11-18)

After user review, the original six variants were found to have too many overlapping elements and layouts that exceeded the 500px height constraint. The concept was radically simplified to a focused set of variants:

### "Clean & Balanced" (New Primary Concept)
- **Composition**: Minimal, uncluttered layout with icon badge at top-left, simple three-card fan below it (K♥, A♣, K♠), and clean typography on the right.
- **Layout**: Horizontal split with visual elements on left (icon + cards) and copy on right (headline, subtitle, benefits).
- **Cards**: Three cards with subtle rotation (-8°, 0°, +8°) creating an elegant fan without overlaps.
- **Typography**: Large "Soli" headline (52px), subtitle "Classic solitaire, thoughtfully refined", and bullet-point benefits with small green dots.
- **Benefits**: Clean bullet list with simple dot indicators instead of badge backgrounds.
- **Spacing**: Generous whitespace ensures nothing feels cramped or touches frame edges.
- **Safe Frame**: All elements comfortably within 644×278px inner composition area.

### "Badge Highlights"
- **Goal**: Retain the Clean & Balanced layout but make the benefit callouts feel more premium.
- **Badges**: Benefits now live inside high-contrast white pills with teal borders (`#16a085`) and soft drop shadows so they stand off the felt background.
- **Alignment**: Composition is vertically centered within the safe frame; the headline gains a short accent underline for added hierarchy.
- **Copy**: Same headline/subtitle as Clean & Balanced to keep messaging consistent across both evergreen variants.

### "Numbered Showcase"
- **Composition**: Four cards (A♥, K♣, A♦, K♠) stagger diagonally with the icon floating above their overlap.
- **Benefits**: Presented as numbered square callouts (1, 2, 3) to create a playful, editorial feel.
- **Usage**: A slightly more expressive option that still reuses live card components and stays inside the safe frame.

### "Icon Pulse" (Retained)
- **Status**: Kept as-is because it was the least broken of the original concepts.
- **Composition**: Circular arrangement of 6 cards (4 Aces + 2 Kings) orbiting the central icon with halo effect.
- **Layout**: Similar left-right split with orbital visual on left, copy panel on right.
- **Typography**: Adapted to match the minimal style of Clean & Balanced variant.

### Key Improvements
1. **No Overlaps**: All complex tableau, timeline, diamond, and path layouts removed.
2. **Proper Height**: Both variants fit comfortably within the 500px canvas height.
3. **Clear Hierarchy**: Icon and cards on left, copy on right—clean visual flow.
4. **Breathing Room**: Generous spacing eliminates the cramped feeling of previous concepts.
5. **Focused Message**: Simple card arrangements let the copy and benefits stand out.

## Guardrails & Follow-up
- Maintain the `FEATURE_SAFE_MARGIN_RATIO` constant and the new inner padding (`SAFE_INNER_PADDING`) so layout tweaks never drift into the bleed zone.
- Keep the optional safe-frame overlay wired to the toggle button for QA screenshots before export.
- Leave variant metadata, descriptions, and concept narrative in the component—marketing reviews now happen directly in the screen before a layout renders.
- Preserve theme-aware palettes to ensure both light and dark captures stay legible.
- Checklist for updates: confirm copy strings, icon resolution, theme contrast, variant descriptions, benefit order, and capture screenshots via `/feature-graphic` with the safe frame enabled.

## Test Plan
- Peer-review concept doc for clarity and completeness.
- Validate cited links remain accessible.
- Ensure implementation team confirms variant feasibility before coding.

## Verification
- Concept brief shared with stakeholders (user) for approval prior to UI refresh.
