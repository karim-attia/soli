| 2025-11-14 10:20:00 | Status Change | InProgress | Review | Documented safe area guidance and sources for validation. | ai_agent |

## Requirements
- Capture current safe area dimensions or guidance for Google Play feature graphics (1024×500).
- Provide at least one official or authoritative source URL for the safe area guidance.
- Summarize implications for compositing the Klondike layout and marketing copy.

## Implementation Plan
1. Gather documentation from official Google Play resources and corroborating recent references describing feature graphic safe areas.
2. Extract specific pixel measurements or percentage-based safe zones.
3. Summarize findings clearly and note any cautions (e.g., text placement, logo visibility).
4. Document references and findings within this task file for ongoing access.

## Research Findings
- **Dimensions & format** – Google Play’s listing specs reiterate that feature graphics must be exactly 1024×500 pixels, JPEG or 24-bit PNG without alpha transparency, and free of promotional claims.<br>
  Source: [Android Developers – Core app quality](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/core-app-quality#storelisting)
- **Primary safe area** – Industry practitioners reference Google’s 2015 Android Developers blog which depicts a “safe frame” that centers critical content and avoids UI overlays; Space Ape Games’ breakdown quantifies this as keeping key art ≥15% away from each edge (≈77 px left/right and ≈75 px top/bottom on a 1024×500 canvas).<br>
  Sources: [Android Developers Blog – Feature graphic best practices](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2015/12/feature-graphic-best-practices.html), [Space Ape Games case study](https://spaceapegames.artstation.com/blog/oep0/adventures-with-the-google-feature-graphics)
- **Practical implication** – Position card clusters, iconography, and benefit copy inside a central ~870×350 zone, leaving outer margins for bleed so cropping in dynamic surfaces (e.g., main store feed) never clips text or the tableau.
- **Copy guidance** – Avoid crowded text and keep messaging concise so small render targets remain legible.<br>

## Test Plan
- Confirm cited sources are accessible and dated within the last two years or still labeled current by Google.
- Verify that safe area figures align across at least two sources or that discrepancies are noted.
- Ensure documentation includes actionable guidance for positioning UI elements on the feature graphic screen.

## Verification
- Double-check source URLs and capture date.
- Share findings with design stakeholders for acknowledgment (informal review acceptable).
