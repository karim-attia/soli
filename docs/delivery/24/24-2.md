# [24-2] Build static feature graphic composition screen

[Back to task list](../tasks.md)

## Description
Implement a dedicated React screen that renders a 1024×500 composition using existing Klondike UI elements, the app icon, and marketing copy for Google Play feature graphic captures.

## Requirements
- Render the Klondike layout using existing components, including `CardVisual`, within a container constrained to the 1024×500 aspect ratio (no rounded corners).
- Include the app icon asset within the composition.
- Display marketing benefits copy blocks: “Free & no ads”, “Solvable games”, “Quick undo time travel through game”.
- Respect safe area guidance documented in Task 24-1 and annotate code with brief comments referencing the requirement.

## Implementation Plan
1. Create a new Expo Router route (`app/feature-graphic.tsx`) that renders a Tamagui-based layout sized to 1024×500 logical units.
2. Reuse existing Klondike component assemblies (e.g., tableau representation, `CardVisual`) to stage cards in an attractive arrangement.
3. Import the app icon asset and position it alongside marketing copy blocks styled with Tamagui primitives.
4. Apply layout constraints to keep critical content within the documented safe area while filling the canvas background.
5. Add minimal comments referencing safe area and copy requirements for traceability.

## Test Plan
- Run `expo`/`yarn dev` and load `/feature-graphic` route to ensure the composition renders without runtime errors.
- Verify canvas dimensions maintain a 1024×500 ratio across device sizes (e.g., using `AspectRatio` or fixed sizing wrapper).
- Confirm copy strings match the specified text exactly and that components render using Tamagui primitives.
- Check visual alignment against safe area documentation from Task 24-1.

## Verification
- Capture a screenshot in the simulator to confirm layout and copy appearance.
- Share render with marketing stakeholders for manual approval.

## Files Modified
- app/feature-graphic.tsx
