## Requirements
- Cover all success criteria in scripted runs across target platforms.
- Capture video evidence of representative celebrations and dialog transitions.
- Record any issues and file follow-up tasks as needed.

## Implementation Plan
1. Assemble deterministic win scenarios to trigger celebrations reliably.
2. Run scenarios on iOS, Android (if available), and web builds.
3. Capture screen recordings and annotate observations.
4. Validate that manual interactions remain blocked until dialog appears.
5. Collate findings into the Verification section for user review.

## Test Plan
- Manual: Execute scripted win sequences verifying celebration randomization, lock behavior, and dialog launch.
- Manual: Confirm new game dialog lacks cancel when launched post-win.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`.
- `npx expo export --platform web --output-dir dist-web`.

## Verification
- Attach recordings and test notes to this task before requesting review.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`.
- `npx expo export --platform web --output-dir dist-web`.

## Files Modified
- Documentation / evidence only (no code changes expected).
