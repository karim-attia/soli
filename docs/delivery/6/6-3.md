## Requirements
- Reuse the current new game dialog component.
- Remove or hide the cancel option when invoked post-celebration.
- Ensure dialog appears immediately after celebration animations end.
- Reset dialog state appropriately when a manual new game is requested.

## Implementation Plan
1. Identify the dialog invocation path in the header/new game controls.
2. Expose an imperative handle or event that celebrations can trigger once animations complete.
3. Provide dialog props/state to conditionally hide cancel when invoked from celebration flow.
4. Confirm the dialog still offers cancel when accessed manually before a win.
5. Update documentation around dialog usage for future reference.

## Test Plan
- Manual: Win a game, observe celebrations, and ensure the dialog appears with only a confirmation option.
- Manual: Trigger new game manually mid-round to confirm cancel remains available.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`.
- `yarn test --watch=false` (if components have coverage).

## Verification
- Manual verification on device/web of dialog behavior in both celebration and standard contexts.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`.

## Files Modified
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
- `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`
