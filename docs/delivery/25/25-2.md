# 25-2 E2E CoS Test: card visual proportionality

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description
Coordinate with the user to re-run the automated demo game on the connected phone after implementing proportional cards to confirm the on-device build renders the calibrated proportions. Collect the resulting logs from the user instead of launching the flow locally.

## Status History
| Timestamp | Event Type | From Status | To Status | Details | User |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------|---------|------|
| 2025-11-14 11:05:20 | Created | N/A | Proposed | Documented end-to-end proportionality validation scope. | ai_agent |
| 2025-11-14 11:05:50 | Status Change | Proposed | Agreed | User approved E2E validation task. | user |

## Requirements
- Work with the user to trigger the release build via `yarn demo:auto-solve` on their machine and device.
- Capture the shared demo output/logcat snippet showing the final proportional layout (no card overlap) and archive it in this task file for traceability.
- Summarize the observed measurements and any visual notes supplied by the user.
- Provide verification evidence (log snippet or screenshot reference) confirming the proportions matched expectations.

## Implementation Plan
- Await completion of Task 25-1 so the proportional style changes are available.
- Ask the user to run `yarn demo:auto-solve` (per `.cursor/commands/demo-mode.md`) and share the resulting logs.
- Review the provided logs for `[SoliDev]` telemetry or other verification cues.
- Store the relevant log excerpt in this document’s Verification section.

## Test Plan
- The user’s shared demo run serves as the test: success is defined by the automated game completing without crashes while keeping the updated proportions.
- Confirm through the provided evidence that no layout regressions (overlap, clipping) occurred.

## Verification
- Pending demo auto-solve run after Task 25-1 completes.
