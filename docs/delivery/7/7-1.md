## Requirements
- Remove the bottom tab navigator UI from the app shell.
- Add burger menu links to reach the Tab Two and Hello content screens.
- Ensure routing remains functional on web and native platforms.

## Implementation Plan
1. Review current navigation setup in `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` and root layout.
2. Remove tab navigator configuration and ensure the primary game screen remains default.
3. Add menu items in the burger drawer linking to existing screen components (likely via stack routes).
4. Test navigation flows on web and native, including deep link/back behavior.
5. Update documentation describing navigation changes.

## Test Plan
- Manual: Open burger menu and confirm Tab Two/Hello pages are accessible.
- Manual: Verify there is no residual bottom tab bar.
- Manual: Ensure hardware back and gesture navigation return to the game screen properly.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`.

## Verification
- Manual navigation walkthrough on iOS simulator and web.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`.

## Files Modified
- `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`
- `app/_layout.tsx`
- `app/(tabs)/two.tsx`
