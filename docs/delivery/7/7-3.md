## Requirements
- Apply a green felt-inspired background behind the game board with sufficient contrast.
- Remove the bottom draw button and adjust spacing/layout accordingly.
- Ensure alternative draw controls remain accessible (e.g., tap on stock).

## Implementation Plan
1. Identify style definitions for the game surface in `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`.
2. Introduce theme constants for light/dark friendly green variants (tie into PBI-9 later).
3. Remove the bottom draw button component and rebalance layout spacing/margins.
4. Verify draw interactions via stock tap still function.
5. Update documentation/screenshots as needed.

## Test Plan
- Manual: Confirm the game board shows the new green background on web and native.
- Manual: Ensure drawing from the stock remains intuitive without the button.
- Manual: Check contrast and readability of cards on the new background in both light/dark modes.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`.

## Verification
- Manual playtest on iOS simulator and web build.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`.

## Files Modified
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
- `src/theme/colors.ts` (new or updated)
