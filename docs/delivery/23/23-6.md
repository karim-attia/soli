## Requirements
- Execute manual and automated checks covering gameplay, auto-complete, undo scrubbing, celebrations, and persistence flows.
- Document findings, including any follow-up issues or fixes required.
- Confirm linting, type checks, and relevant tests pass without errors.

## Implementation Plan
1. After tasks 23-2 through 23-5 land, run the demo and standard gameplay scenarios to validate behaviour.
2. Capture verification notes (screenshots, logs, or summary) in this task file.
3. Re-run `yarn lint`, `yarn tsc --noEmit`, and any existing test suites.
4. Flag regressions or edge cases for future work if discovered.

## Test Plan
- Manual playthrough (new game, undo flows, auto-complete, celebration) ensuring no UI regressions.
- Automated checks: `yarn lint`, `yarn tsc --noEmit`, plus existing test suites.

## Verification
- Document successful verification with timestamps and evidence.
- Obtain user confirmation that functionality remains intact.

## Files Modified
- _TBD during implementation_
