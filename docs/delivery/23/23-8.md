# 23-8 Centralize navigation triggers

[Back to task list](../tasks.md)

## Description
Standardize how the drawer toggle is invoked across tabs by abstracting the logic out of the Klondike screen and removing the left-edge swipe gesture that currently opens navigation.

| 2025-11-12 18:30:00 | Status Change | Proposed | InProgress | Begin extracting drawer logic and disabling swipe gesture. | ai_agent |
| 2025-11-12 18:44:00 | Status Change | InProgress | Review | Shared drawer opener created and swipe gesture disabled. | ai_agent |

## Requirements
- Extract the drawer-opening logic from `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` into a reusable helper/hook so that other tabs can consume it.
- Disable the left-edge swipe gesture for opening the drawer, leaving only the burger button.
- Ensure navigation functionality remains accessible and document any new helper entry points.

## Implementation Plan
1. Identify the existing drawer toggle implementation in the Klondike screen.
2. Move the logic into a shared utility (e.g., a hook under `src/navigation/`) that can be reused by other tabs.
3. Update the Klondike screen to consume the shared logic and disable the swipe gesture at the navigator level.
4. Verify other tabs can adopt the same helper without regressions.

## Implementation Notes
- Added `useDrawerOpener` and `openNavigationDrawer` in `src/navigation` to encapsulate the drawer dispatch.
- Updated all drawer consumers (`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`, `(tabs)/two.tsx`, `(tabs)/hello.tsx`, `app/history.tsx`, `app/settings.tsx`) to rely on the shared opener instead of ad-hoc callbacks.
- Disabled the drawer swipe gesture globally via `swipeEnabled: false` in `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`.

## Test Plan
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`
- Manual: Open drawer via burger and verify swipe is disabled _(pending)_.

## Verification
- All screens now reuse the shared drawer opener helper.
- Drawer swipe gesture is disabled via navigator configuration.
- TypeScript build passes.
