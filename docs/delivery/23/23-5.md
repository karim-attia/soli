# 23-5 Integrate refactored structure

[Back to task list](../tasks.md)

## Description
Recompose the Klondike screen using the extracted components and hooks, ensuring wiring is clean, documented, and aligned with the new architecture.

## Requirements
- Update `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` to focus on orchestrating state, passing props to extracted components, and coordinating reducers and controllers.
- Replace inline component definitions with imports from `src/features/klondike` modules.
- Add descriptive comments above new component invocations and hook usages per the user request.
- Ensure TypeScript types remain accurate and there are no unused exports.

## Implementation Plan
1. Remove inlined component definitions from the screen file, replacing them with imports from tasks 23-2 through 23-4 outputs.
2. Wire extracted hooks, ensuring dependencies are memoised as needed to avoid unnecessary renders.
3. Add explanatory comments above each major component or hook call to describe its role.
4. Validate bundler paths and Expo configuration for the new directories.

## Test Plan
- Run the app or `yarn demo:auto-solve` to verify the screen behaves identically after integration.
- Execute linting and type checks (`yarn lint`, `yarn tsc --noEmit`).

## Verification
- Confirm `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` is significantly shorter and easier to navigate, with clear sections for state, hooks, and layout composition.
- Ensure no runtime warnings or regressions appear after integrating the refactor.

## Files Modified
- _TBD during implementation_
