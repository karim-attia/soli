# 23-15 Extract auto-queue runner hook

[Back to task list](../tasks.md)

## Description
Move the auto-complete queue orchestration out of `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` into a reusable hook that coordinates dispatch delays, keeping the screen focused on wiring.

| 2025-11-12 20:13:00 | Status Change | Proposed | InProgress | Began moving auto-queue orchestration into a hook. | ai_agent |
| 2025-11-12 20:25:00 | Status Change | InProgress | Review | Hook created and screen refactored. | ai_agent |

## Requirements
- Create a `useAutoQueueRunner` hook under `src/features/klondike/hooks` that encapsulates the auto-complete timer logic.
- Allow configurable delays so the screen can pass move/interval durations.
- Replace the inline auto-queue `useEffect` in the screen with the new hook.
- Preserve existing behaviour for `ADVANCE_AUTO_QUEUE` dispatching.

## Implementation Plan
1. Implement the new hook with a descriptive comment and effect.
2. Import and use the hook inside `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`, passing required parameters.
3. Remove the original inline `useEffect` and clean up related code.
4. Run TypeScript checks.

## Implementation Notes
- Added `useAutoQueueRunner` to encapsulate the prior auto-queue effect with configurable delays.
- Replaced the inline `useEffect` in `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` with the new hook invocation.

## Test Plan
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`

## Verification
- Auto queue orchestration lives in the new hook and type checks pass.

## Files Modified
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
- `src/features/klondike/hooks/useAutoQueueRunner.ts`
