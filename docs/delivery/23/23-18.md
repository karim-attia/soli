# 23-18 Refresh inline function documentation

[Back to task list](../tasks.md)

## Description
Add concise, single-line descriptions above every local function/effect within `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`, including selection utilities, callbacks, and effects.

| 2025-11-12 20:13:00 | Status Change | Proposed | InProgress | Began adding descriptive comments across the screen file. | ai_agent |
| 2025-11-12 20:25:00 | Status Change | InProgress | Review | Comment sweep completed. | ai_agent |

## Requirements
- Ensure every function/callback/effect within `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` has a one-line description comment.
- Clarify the purpose of `collectSelectionCardIds` and `resolveSelectionCardIds` for posterity.
- Answer the lingering questions about selection utilities via inline comments where appropriate.
- Keep TypeScript compilation passing after edits.

## Implementation Plan
1. Sweep the screen file and add comments before each function/effect.
2. Expand existing comments where necessary to explain selection helpers.
3. Remove any now-obsolete code left over from manual selection.
4. Run TypeScript checks.

## Implementation Notes
- Added or expanded one-line comments ahead of every local function/effect inside `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`.
- Clarified why `collectSelectionCardIds`/`resolveSelectionCardIds` remain even after manual selection removal.

## Test Plan
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`

## Verification
- Documentation comments now precede every function/effect and TypeScript passes.

## Files Modified
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
