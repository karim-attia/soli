# 23-10 Prune residual manual-selection helpers

[Back to task list](../tasks.md)

## Description
Remove leftover utilities and imports tied to the deprecated manual selection workflow, tidy associated handlers, and ensure the Klondike screen reflects the streamlined interaction model.

## Requirements
- Remove unused imports (`rankToLabel`, `SUIT_SYMBOLS`) and any other remnants of manual selection logic.
- Evaluate `collectSelectionCardIds`, `resolveSelectionCardIds`, and `clearSelection` for continued necessity; delete or relocate them if no longer required.
- Simplify `handleFoundationPress` after the manual selection pathway removal.
- Ensure flight controller still receives required selection card IDs for animation flows.

## Implementation Plan
1. Identify imports and functions no longer needed post-manual selection removal.
2. Remove or refactor the helpers (`collectSelectionCardIds`, `resolveSelectionCardIds`, `clearSelection`) based on current usage.
3. Update dependent code paths and verify TypeScript.
4. Run type checks to confirm no regressions.

## Implementation Notes
- Removed unused `rankToLabel` / `SUIT_SYMBOLS` imports and pruned the dormant `clearSelection` helper.
- Replaced the manual-selection `handleColumnPress` logic with a no-op handler and simplified `handleFoundationPress` to auto-move only.
- Kept `collectSelectionCardIds` and `resolveSelectionCardIds` to support animation flights for auto-move selections; added clean dependency wiring.

## Test Plan
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`

## Verification
- TypeScript compilation passes after the cleanup.
- Klondike screen no longer references manual selection helpers or unused imports.

## Files Modified
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
