# [10-2] Persist shuffle outcomes

[Back to task list](../tasks.md)

## Description
Save shuffle identifiers, timestamps, and solved/not-solved status to persistent storage so the history page can render accurate records.

## Status History

## Requirements
- Record shuffle ID, foundation completion state, and completion timestamp after each game.
- Persist data using the same storage mechanism as PBI 9 to avoid duplication.
- Support retrieval for list rendering and analytics.

## Implementation Plan
1. Define a history entry schema and integrate it into the storage layer introduced in PBI 9.
2. Hook into game completion flow to append new entries.
3. Provide helper functions to load and update history records.
4. Ensure storage truncates or archives data if it grows beyond limits (optional but documented).
5. Write unit tests covering serialization and retrieval.

## Test Plan
- Manual: Complete games (solved/unsolved) and confirm entries appear in storage (console/logging).
- `yarn test --watch=false` for history helper coverage.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`.

## Verification
- Manual verification of persisted data and retrieval in app.
- `yarn test --watch=false`.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`.

## Files Modified
- `src/state/history.ts` (new)
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
