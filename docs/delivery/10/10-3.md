## Requirements
- Compute and display the total number of solved games at the top of the history page.
- Render a badge or chip next to entries flagged as solvable shuffles (data from PBI 11).
- Ensure layout remains accessible and responsive.

## Implementation Plan
1. Extend history data model with `solvable` flag (populated by PBI 11).
2. Implement aggregate calculation + UI for solved totals.
3. Add badge components to each history row when applicable.
4. Include tests for aggregate calculations.
5. Validate design with both light/dark themes.

## Test Plan
- Manual: Verify solved counter updates after multiple games.
- Manual: Confirm solvable badge displays correctly when flag is present.
- `yarn test --watch=false` for aggregation helper.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`.

## Verification
- Manual UI verification of counts and badges.
- `yarn test --watch=false`.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`.

## Files Modified
- `app/history.tsx`
- `src/state/history.ts`
