## Requirements
- Provide a burger menu entry labeled “History”.
- Display a list of past games with shuffle ID, completion status, and timestamp.
- Handle empty states gracefully with informative messaging.

## Implementation Plan
1. Add navigation route for History and link it from burger menu.
2. Build a Tamagui list view with cards or rows showing each game's metadata.
3. Include solved badges placeholder (wired in Task 10-3).
4. Provide pagination or lazy loading if history grows large.
5. Ensure accessibility labels are present for assistive tech.

## Test Plan
- Manual: Navigate to History and confirm list renders with sample data.
- Manual: Verify empty state message appears when no history exists.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`.

## Verification
- Manual: Validate list header stats, badges, and navigation to the detail preview screen across web + simulator.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit` (2025-11-02 12:05 UTC) ✅

## Files Modified
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
- `app/history.tsx` (new)
- `app/history/[entryId].tsx` (new)
