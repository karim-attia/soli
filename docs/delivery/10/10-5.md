# [10-5] Refine history page visual design

[Back to task list](../tasks.md)

## Description
Refine the visual design of the history page to improve card recognition and reducing "boringness" in light mode. This involves a complete color concept for stats and game cards, ensuring good contrast and visual hierarchy.

## Status History

## Requirements
- Redesign stats tiles to be visually distinct and interesting. ✅
- Redesign history list items (cards) to pop against the background in light mode. ✅
- Ensure text is legible and status is clearly communicated via color. ✅

## Implementation Plan
1. Update `HistoryStatsRow` to use themed backgrounds corresponding to their content (e.g., Green for Solved). ✅
2. Update `HistoryListItem` to use a card style with better elevation (shadows) and status indicators (e.g., colored borders or badges). ✅
3. Adjust spacing and typography as needed to support the new look. ✅

## Test Plan
- Manual: Verify light mode rendering shows distinct cards.
- Manual: Verify dark mode still looks good (Tamagui handles this, but check tokens).
- `yarn tsc --noEmit` to ensure no regressions.

## Files Modified
- `app/history.tsx`
