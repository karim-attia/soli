| 1 | Mobile solitaire fan | As a player I want a Klondike Solitaire screen built with React Native and Tamagui so that I can play draw-1 games with undo on my phone. | InProgress | 1. Backlog, PRD, and policy-required task docs exist and stay synchronized.<br>2. The app renders a full Klondike layout (stock, waste, tableau, foundations) in draw-1 mode with valid move enforcement.<br>3. Players can draw, move cards via tap interactions (auto-move) or tap-and-hold for manual placement, start a new game from the header, undo the most recent move, and recycle the stock.<br>4. The board occupies the full width (no border) with symmetric margins, foundations on the left, draw/waste (fan of three) on the right, and cards show rank/suit in the top corners plus a centered suit icon for readability.<br>5. Auto-complete animates at ~5 cards per second, draws from stock if needed, and celebrates wins with a ðŸŽ‰ toast once foundations complete.<br>6. Project builds successfully via Expo / React Native tooling.<br>[View Details](./1/prd.md) |
| 2 | UI polish | Animate Solitaire interactions (card movement, waste-fan slide, invalid move wiggle) for extra delight. | Proposed | 1. Tableau/foundation card moves animate quickly.<br>2. Waste fan shifts left smoothly when a new card is drawn.<br>3. Invalid tap triggers a subtle wiggle instead of a toast.<br>4. Implementation documented under dedicated tasks (TBD). |
| 3 | Build engineer | As a developer I want Expo dependencies aligned with SDK 53 guidance so that builds and `expo-doctor` pass without warnings. | Done | 1. Remove disallowed direct dependencies (`@types/react-native`, `@expo/metro-config`).<br>2. Install required peer deps (e.g., `expo-constants`).<br>3. Upgrade Expo/Metro/React Native packages to the versions `expo install --check` expects for SDK 53.<br>4. `npx expo-doctor` completes without dependency errors. |
