## Requirements
- Define coverage that exercises long-press detection, slider presentation, and board updates while dragging.
- Include scenarios for scrubbing back to the beginning and forward to the latest action without branching.
- Document manual or automated steps needed to assert CoS, noting any tooling required.
- Ensure results capture regressions, including fallback to single-step undo when scrubbing is not invoked.

## Implementation Plan
- Outline end-to-end scenarios referencing board setup steps and expected visuals/state changes.
- Determine whether existing dev tools or automation (e.g., Playwright/Detox) will be used; if unavailable, specify manual checklist.
- Add instrumentation or logging hooks if needed to observe state indices during tests.
- Prepare data capture notes for future automated coverage.

## Test Plan
- Long-press undo after several moves and verify the slider overlay and dimmed button appear.
- Drag to the leftmost position and confirm the initial deal is restored with no residual animations.
- Drag forward to the latest move, confirm state replays correctly, and release to commit.
- Tap undo normally after scrubbing to confirm single-step undo still works from the committed state.

## Verification
- To be completed during implementation.

## Files Modified
- To be determined.
