## Requirements
- Validate that each acceptance criterion in PBI 22 is satisfied during interactive testing.
- Capture any deviations or regressions discovered during manual or automated runs.
- Document verification steps and results in this task file.

## Implementation Plan
- After tasks 22-1 and 22-2 land, run the app and execute repeated draw sequences, including recycling, while observing animations.
- Capture screen recordings or notes if anomalies surface for rapid iteration.
- Update the Verification section with the commands and scenarios exercised.

## Test Plan
- Launch the demo auto-solve (`yarn demo:auto-solve`) to observe automated draws and ensure animations originate from the top card.
- Manually draw three cards in succession, confirming the waste fan slides left and the third card fades out without translation.
- Trigger an undo followed by redraw to ensure animations remain consistent.

## Verification
- `yarn demo:auto-solve` *(timed out waiting for demo auto-sequence; requires rerun on connected device)*
- Manual draw/undo cycles observed by user during approval (2025-11-12)
