## Requirements
- Add a toggle control labeled clearly about sharing solved games.
- Default opt-in to off for privacy.
- Persist selection via existing settings storage.

## Implementation Plan
1. Extend settings schema with `shareSolvedGames` boolean.
2. Add toggle UI to Settings under a new “Community” section with explanatory copy.
3. Integrate with persistence layer from PBI 9.
4. Ensure toggle availability only when solvable mode is enabled (or explain behavior otherwise).

## Test Plan
- Manual: Toggle setting and ensure value persists across restarts.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`.
- `yarn test --watch=false` for settings reducer coverage.

## Verification
- Manual verification of toggle behavior and persistence.
- `yarn test --watch=false`.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`.

## Files Modified
- `app/settings.tsx`
- `src/state/settings.ts`
