## Requirements
- Exercise all acceptance criteria across supported platforms.
- Confirm uploads only occur when sharing is enabled and game is solvable.
- Document results including logs and sample payloads.

## Implementation Plan
1. Prepare test plan covering opt-in toggling, telemetry generation, and mock endpoint uploads.
2. Execute on iOS simulator, Android emulator (if available), and web.
3. Capture network logs or mock server responses.
4. Summarize findings and attach in Verification section.

## Test Plan
- Manual: Enable sharing, solve a solvable game, and confirm payload delivered to mock endpoint.
- Manual: Disable sharing and verify no upload occurs.
- Manual: Attempt to share non-solvable game ensuring no payload is sent.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`.
- `npx expo export --platform web --output-dir dist-web`.

## Verification
- Attach logs, payload samples, and notes confirming behavior.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`.
- `npx expo export --platform web --output-dir dist-web`.

## Files Modified
- Documentation / evidence only (no code changes expected).
