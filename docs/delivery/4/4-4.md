## Requirements
- Validate all acceptance criteria in a realistic session (mobile + web).
- Document discovered issues and feed them back into earlier tasks if fixes are needed.
- Capture screen recordings or notes suitable for review sign-off.

## Implementation Plan
1. Prepare scripted scenarios covering undo, manual foundation moves, auto-foundation, and rapid sequential moves.
2. Run through the scenarios on iOS simulator, Android emulator (if available), and web build.
3. Log observations, including FPS or visual anomalies, in the task verification notes.
4. File follow-up defects or adjustments against Tasks 4-1 through 4-3 if gaps are found.
5. Package evidence (video/gif or notes) for user review.

## Test Plan
- Manual: Scenario walkthrough covering each acceptance criterion.
- Capture screen recording demonstrating correct card flight origins and glow timing.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`.
- `npx expo export --platform web --output-dir dist-web` (sanity build check).

## Verification
- Attach walkthrough notes and recordings to task verification section before submitting for review.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`.
- `npx expo export --platform web --output-dir dist-web`.

## Files Modified
- Documentation / evidence assets only (no code changes expected).
