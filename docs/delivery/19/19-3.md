 # [19-3] Reveal initial stock card on new game start
 
 [Back to task list](../tasks.md)
 
 ## Description
 Update the new-game initialization so the first stock card is exposed immediately after dealing while keeping the game timer idle until the player performs the first move.

 ## Requirements
 - Modify the new-game workflow to flip or move the first stock card into the waste pile automatically.
 - Ensure the automatic reveal does not increment the move counter or trigger the game timer.
 - Maintain compatibility with draw-1 rules and undo history.
 - Handle edge cases such as restarting during auto-complete or developer demo modes without regressions.
 - Provide clear separation between automatic setup actions and player-generated moves for analytics/timer purposes.
 
 ## Implementation Plan
 1. Review the current new-game initialization sequence to identify where the stock is shuffled and waste is reset.
 2. Insert logic to draw the first stock card into the waste pile immediately after dealing completes, tagging the action as system-initiated.
 3. Adjust move-count/timer triggers to ignore system-initiated actions while ensuring undo still accounts for them appropriately.
 4. Validate that recycling the stock and subsequent draws remain unaffected and that undo/redo works as expected.
 
 ## Test Plan
 - Manual: Start a new game and confirm the first stock card is visible while timer remains at 0:00.
 - Manual: Make the first move and observe that the timer begins and move count increments correctly.
 - Manual: Use undo immediately after the first player move to ensure the system-initiated reveal does not produce extra entries.
 
 ## Verification
 - Manual gameplay sessions covering new-game, undo, and stock recycle scenarios on iOS and Android simulators.
