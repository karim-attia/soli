 # [19-1] Extend settings with game statistics toggles
 
 [Back to task list](../tasks.md)
 
 ## Description
 Add a “Game Statistics” section to the settings experience that lets players independently toggle the visibility of move count and elapsed time, persisting preferences via the existing settings store.

 ## Requirements
 - Introduce a parent “Game Statistics” grouping within the settings UI under the solitaire configuration area.
 - Provide individual toggles for “Show Move Count” and “Show Game Time”, defaulting to enabled for moves and disabled/enabled per product decision.
 - Persist the toggles to the existing settings state management so values survive app restarts.
 - Ensure toggles are only visible when the solitaire game mode is relevant, matching current settings gating logic.
 - Expose selector/helpers so the Klondike screen can query whether to show each statistic.
 
 ## Implementation Plan
 1. Extend the settings state schema and initial defaults with `showGameMoves` and `showGameTime` flags under a statistics grouping.
 2. Update the persistence layer (AsyncStorage or equivalent) to serialize the new flags with backward-compatible migrations.
 3. Add a new settings section component that surfaces the statistics toggles with descriptive copy, reusing existing theming components.
 4. Export selectors/hooks from the settings module to consume the new flags elsewhere in the app.
 
 ## Test Plan
 - TypeScript: Ensure the project compiles after updating settings types.
 - Manual: Toggle the new settings in the UI, restart the app, and verify persisted values.
 - Manual: Confirm toggles hide/show based on relevant mode gating (if applicable).
 
 ## Verification
 - Manual walkthrough on iOS and Android simulators confirming UI visibility, persistence, and selector values.
- Build: `yarn tsc --noEmit`
