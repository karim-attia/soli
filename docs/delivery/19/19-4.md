 # [19-4] E2E CoS validation
 
 [Back to task list](../tasks.md)
 
 ## Description
 Create and execute end-to-end coverage that validates the game statistics settings, HUD behaviour, timer cadence, and automatic initial stock reveal against the PBI’s Conditions of Satisfaction.

 ## Requirements
 - Cover enabling/disabling statistics toggles and confirm persisted state across app reloads.
 - Verify that the HUD displays move count and/or timer only when toggles are enabled.
 - Assert that the timer starts after the first move, remains idle beforehand, and stops after game completion.
 - Confirm that starting a new game reveals the first stock card while leaving timer at zero until the first move.
 - Capture screenshots or logs as evidence for review where applicable.
 
 ## Implementation Plan
 1. Define E2E scenarios in the existing test harness (Detox/Playwright/etc.) covering settings toggles, HUD visibility, and timer transitions.
 2. Seed game state to simulate first-move timing and win completion, taking advantage of developer hooks if available.
 3. Extend helpers to read HUD values for assertions (e.g., mm:ss text, move count label).
 4. Automate persistence checks by restarting the app within the test flow.
 5. Document test results and attach artefacts for review.
 
 ## Test Plan
 - E2E: Run newly added automated scenarios on both iOS and Android pipelines (or representative simulators).
 - Manual backup: Spot-check on at least one platform to confirm HUD placement and readability.
 
 ## Verification
 - Passing E2E suite with evidence captured and linked in task verification notes.
