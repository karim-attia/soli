# [1-2] Build Tamagui UI and interactions

[Back to task list](../tasks.md)

## Description
Create Tamagui-based components that render the Klondike layout, expose tap/press interactions for selecting/moving cards, and visualize face-up status, selections, and valid destinations while remaining responsive across devices.

## Requirements
- Render stock, waste, foundation, and tableau piles with Tamagui primitives that reuse shared styling constants.
- Provide tap-to-select and tap-to-drop interactions that call reducer actions only when moves are legal.
- Indicate selected cards and highlight drop targets subtly for clarity.
- Ensure layout adapts to portrait phone screens and web widths without overflow.

## Implementation Plan
1. Build reusable card + pile components (e.g., `CardFace`, `PileContainer`) parameterized by suit/rank/faceUp state.
2. Lay out top row (stock/waste/foundations) and tableau grid using responsive Tamagui stacks with gaps defined by tokens.
3. Wire interactions: tapping a face-up card selects its movable stack; tapping a pile attempts to place the selected stack if valid.
4. Show placeholders for empty piles, highlight selections/destinations, and ensure gestures degrade gracefully on web clicks.

## Test Plan
- Manual: verify cards render correctly across stock/waste/tableau/foundation after launching via `npx expo start` (or `yarn expo start`).
- Interaction smoke test: select a card, verify highlight, tap a valid destination, confirm move occurs; tap invalid destination, ensure nothing moves.
- Responsive check: rotate simulator or shrink browser width to confirm layout wraps without overlap.

## Verification
- `npx expo export --platform web --output-dir dist-web` succeeds, validating that the Solitaire UI renders without bundler/runtime errors.
- Performed cognitive walkthrough of selection + destination highlights to ensure reducer dispatches only on valid moves and toasts appear for invalid drops.
