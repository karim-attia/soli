## Requirements
- Document manual/automated steps validating each CoS bullet from the PRD.
- Specify tooling (Expo Go, simulators) plus datasets or seed requirements.
- Track pass/fail results and follow-up issues discovered.

## Implementation Plan
1. Enumerate CoS items and map them to concrete, repeatable test steps.
2. Describe environment setup (commands, expected output) and any fixtures.
3. Record actual execution results and attach evidence/screenshots (future work).

## Test Plan
This task *is* the PBI-level test plan; no extra test plan is needed beyond the documentation produced here. Execution deferred until after implementation tasks 1-1 through 1-3 enter Review.

## Verification
Pending execution.
