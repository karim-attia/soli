# [1-5] Responsive layout + header controls refresh

[Back to task list](../tasks.md)

## Description
Remove reliance on the horizontal ScrollView so the tableau columns always fit within the viewport, auto-resizing card dimensions as needed, and relocate the New Game action into the header area next to the existing "Hello!" button for fast restarts.

## Requirements
- Tableau columns must fit side-by-side regardless of device width by dynamically sizing card width/height ratios (no horizontal scrolling containers).
- Retain readable spacing/gaps while preventing overlapping or clipped cards.
- Move the New Game button into the tab header beside the "Hello!" button without regressing navigation behavior.

## Implementation Plan
1. Derive the available board width via `useWindowDimensions` (or layout event) and compute card width from constants + desired gaps.
2. Replace the horizontal ScrollView with a flex row that distributes seven columns using the computed width, ensuring overflow is eliminated.
3. Extract card dimensions into derived memoized values and apply them consistently to card, slot, and pile styles.
4. Update `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` to include a second header button that dispatches the reducer `NEW_GAME` action through a context or imperative callback.

## Test Plan
- Manual: Rotate simulator / resize browser and confirm seven tableau columns remain visible without horizontal scrolling.
- Manual: Trigger the header New Game button and ensure it resets the board while preserving the Hello link behavior.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit` to guarantee the responsive math + header plumbing type-checks.

## Verification
- Manually resized Expo web view + simulator to confirm all seven tableau columns stay on-screen without horizontal scrolling and that tableau now aligns to the right while foundations remain left.
- Verified the header New Game button (next to "Hello!") resets the reducer state instantly and the waste fan shows the last three cards with only the top one interactive.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit` and `npx expo export --platform web --output-dir dist-web` both pass, covering type safety and bundle integrity.

## Files Modified
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
- `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`
