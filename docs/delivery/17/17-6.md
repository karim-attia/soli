# 17-6 Instrument demo auto-solve build timing

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description
Difficulty: Easy. Capture how long the `demo:autosolve` workflow spends building and installing the release APK and surface an in-terminal progress indicator with basic time estimates.

## Status History
| Timestamp | Event Type | From Status | To Status | Details | User |

| 2025-11-06 14:07:00 | Status Change | Proposed | InProgress | Began implementation to add timing metrics and progress feedback. | ai_agent |

## Requirements
- Measure the elapsed time for the `expo run:android --variant release` step executed within `yarn run demo:autosolve`.
- Display a terminal progress bar that advances from 1 to 10 while the build/install step runs.
- Show both elapsed time and remaining time estimates alongside the progress bar while the command executes.
- Log the final measured duration once the build/install step completes.

## Implementation Plan
- Introduce timing and progress-bar helper utilities within `scripts/run-demo-autosolve.js`, driven by configuration constants for bar width and update cadence.
- Wrap the `expo run:android --variant release` invocation with the new helper to emit progress updates and capture duration.
- Ensure the progress helper gracefully clears the line on completion or failure and prints a summary with both concise and verbose duration formats.
- Keep existing logging semantics while augmenting them with the new measurement output.

## Test Plan
- Run `yarn run demo:autosolve` with a connected device/emulator and verify the progress bar updates from 1 to 10 while showing elapsed and estimated remaining time.
- Confirm the script logs the measured duration once the build/install step completes successfully.
- Validate the script surfaces the partial progress and still reports a failure if the build step exits with a non-zero status.

## Verification
- To be completed during implementation.
