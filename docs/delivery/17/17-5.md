## Requirements
- Prevent all toast notifications from displaying in the current build.
- Ensure removal does not trigger runtime errors or unhandled promises.
- Keep code paths ready for future reintroduction (e.g., behind a flag or stub).

## Implementation Plan
- Locate the toast utility wrapper or direct usage throughout the codebase.
- Introduce a centralized no-op implementation or guard to bypass display.
- Remove or suppress any invocation sites that cannot rely on the central guard.
- Verify developer-mode or debug features continue to function without toasts.

## Test Plan
- Trigger actions that previously emitted toasts (e.g., invalid moves, game completion) and confirm no toast appears.
- Scan logs for warnings/errors related to toast handling.

## Verification
- User approval after policy review; awaiting future manual smoke test of gameplay and solver screens.
