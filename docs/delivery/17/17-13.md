# [17-13] Apply Material Design styling to native Android switches

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Apply theme-aware Material Design styling to native Android switches using Tamagui's `nativeProps` prop. This enhances the visual polish of settings toggles on Android while maintaining the fast native rendering.

## Requirements

1. Use Tamagui's `nativeProps` prop to pass `thumbColor` and `trackColor` to native Android switches
2. Apply theme-aware colors that adapt to light/dark mode
3. Only apply on Android (iOS native switches already look appropriate)
4. Maintain existing `native` prop for fast rendering performance

## Technical Research

### Approach Selected
Use `nativeProps` with `thumbColor` and `trackColor` - this is a lightweight enhancement that:
- Keeps native switch performance
- Adds theme colors without additional packages
- Works seamlessly with Tamagui's theming system

### Alternative Considered
`@rn-nui/switch` package provides full Material Design 3 switches with checkmark icons, but requires:
- Installing new package
- Changing Android theme to `Theme.Material3.DayNight.NoActionBar`
- More complex integration

This was deemed unnecessary for current polish goals.

### Implementation Pattern
```tsx
<Switch
  native
  nativeProps={Platform.OS === 'android' ? {
    thumbColor: theme.color.val,
    trackColor: { 
      false: theme.color5.val, 
      true: theme.color10.val 
    },
  } : undefined}
>
  <Switch.Thumb />
</Switch>
```

## Implementation Plan

1. Modify `ToggleRow` component in `app/settings.tsx`
2. Add Platform check to only apply on Android
3. Use `useTheme()` hook to get theme-aware colors
4. Pass colors via `nativeProps` for native Android switches

## Test Plan

### Success Criteria
- Android: Switches display with theme-appropriate colors
- iOS: Switches remain unchanged (native iOS styling)
- Dark/light mode: Colors adapt appropriately
- TypeScript compiles without errors

### Manual Verification
- Launch app on Android emulator/device
- Navigate to Settings screen
- Verify switch thumbs and tracks use theme colors
- Toggle between light/dark mode and verify colors adapt

## Files Modified

- `app/settings.tsx` - ToggleRow component
