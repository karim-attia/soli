# 17-7 Make auto-complete slightly faster

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description
Difficulty: Easy. Reduce the delay between queued auto-complete actions so the endgame sequence resolves more quickly without compromising animation smoothness.

## Requirements
- Shorten the time between auto-complete queue steps to make endgame completion feel snappier.
- Maintain stable card flight animations with no overlap or missing frames.
- Ensure manual gameplay, undo, and celebration flows remain unaffected.

## Implementation Plan
- Audit the auto-queue timing constants in `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` and any related screens that drive auto-complete pacing.
- Adjust the base interval and move delay buffers to reduce idle time while still allowing card flights to finish.
- Re-run auto-complete scenarios to ensure the queue advances consistently and other subsystems continue functioning correctly.

## Test Plan
- Trigger auto-complete on a near-complete game and observe that moves advance more quickly while animations stay smooth.
- Run `yarn demo:auto-solve` to confirm the automated sequence completes without hangs or skipped moves.
- Verify manual draw, undo, and celebration behaviours still operate as before.

## Verification
- Not yet executed; pending manual observation of auto-complete pacing after build.

## Files Modified
- app/(tabs)/index.tsx
- app/(tabs)/two.tsx
