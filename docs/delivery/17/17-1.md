[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description
Difficulty: Medium. Refine the waste fan draw animation so the newly drawn card slides into position without overshooting or jitter.

## Requirements
- Remove overshoot and bounce when animating newly drawn cards into the waste fan.
- Maintain animation responsiveness; total motion should still feel quick.
- Ensure changes do not regress other card-motion behaviours.

## Implementation Plan
- Audit the animation configuration used by the waste fan draw sequence (likely in `src/solitaire/klondike.ts`).
- Adjust easing curves or target positions to prevent overshoot; consider clamping the final position.
- Verify animation durations remain aligned with UX expectations.
- Regression test against undo and stock recycle flows.

## Test Plan
- Manually draw cards repeatedly and confirm the waste fan slides without overshoot or jitter.
- Draw through the full stock, recycle, and ensure animation remains smooth.
- Confirm undoing a draw still animates correctly.

## Verification
- To be completed during implementation.

## Files Modified
- To be determined.
