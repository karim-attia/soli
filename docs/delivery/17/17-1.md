# 17-1 Smooth waste fan draw animation

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description
Difficulty: Medium. Refine the waste fan draw animation so the newly drawn card slides into position without overshooting or jitter.

## Requirements
- Remove overshoot and bounce when animating newly drawn cards into the waste fan.
- Maintain animation responsiveness; total motion should still feel quick.
- Ensure changes do not regress other card-motion behaviours.
- Guarantee the final card alignment matches the steady-state fan spacing with no residual drift.

## Implementation Plan
- Audit the animation configuration used by the waste fan draw sequence (likely in `src/solitaire/klondike.ts`).
- Adjust entry offsets and animation timing so new cards interpolate directly to their fan positions without overshoot.
- Ensure the duration stays at fast cadence while respecting the updated offsets.
- Verify animation durations remain aligned with UX expectations.
- Regression test against undo and stock recycle flows.

## Test Plan
- Manually draw cards repeatedly and confirm the waste fan slides without overshoot or jitter.
- Draw through the full stock, recycle, and ensure animation remains smooth.
- Confirm undoing a draw still animates correctly.
- Observe that the card settles cleanly with no lingering position corrections after the animation completes.

## Verification
- To be completed during implementation.
