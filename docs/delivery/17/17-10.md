## Requirements
- Modify the DEFAULT_SETTINGS in src/state/settings.tsx to set cardFlip: true
- Ensure the change maintains backward compatibility for existing users who have already set their preferences

## Implementation Plan
1. Update the cardFlip default value in DEFAULT_SETTINGS from false to true
2. Verify that existing user preferences are preserved (this is handled by the mergeSettings logic)

## Verification
- Check that new installations have card flip animation enabled by default
- Confirm existing users' settings are not affected

## Files Modified
- src/state/settings.tsx
