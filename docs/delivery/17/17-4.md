[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description
Difficulty: Medium. Resume in-progress games without animations after app restart, and automatically start a new game when the previous session ended in a win.

| 2025-11-06 09:45:00 | Status Change | Proposed | InProgress | Implementation started focusing on game state hydration without replay animations. | ai_agent |

## Requirements
- On app restart, detect whether the last session ended mid-game or on a completed game.
- For ongoing games, hydrate state without replaying animations.
- For completed games, bypass hydration of the finished state and start a new shuffle.
- Preserve user settings and history logging behaviour.

## Implementation Plan
- Review persistence logic for game state and animation flags.
- Introduce metadata indicating whether the last game was completed.
- During hydration, suppress animation triggers when resuming an in-progress game.
- When the last game finished, invoke the new game flow immediately.

## Test Plan
- Finish a game, relaunch the app, and confirm a new game starts instantly.
- Exit mid-game, relaunch, and confirm the board returns without animations.
- Ensure undo history behaves correctly after resume.

## Verification
- To be completed during implementation.

## Files Modified
- To be determined.
