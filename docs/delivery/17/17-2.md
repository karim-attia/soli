# 17-2 Fix startup layout shift

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description
Difficulty: Hard. Diagnose and eliminate layout shifts that occur during app startup, ensuring the initial frame is stable.

## Requirements
- Identify the source(s) of layout shift on app launch.
- Adjust rendering sequence or placeholder layouts to keep initial geometry stable.
- Ensure the fix does not noticeably delay first render.

## Implementation Plan
- Record startup performance trace to capture layout shift metrics.
- Inspect initial render components (navigation container, Tamagui theming, solitaire board) for conditional layout changes.
- Add layout guards or precomputed measurements to stabilize positions before first frame.
- Validate across device sizes or orientations used during testing.

## Test Plan
- Instrument startup with `LayoutAnimation` debugging or React Native dev tools to confirm layout shift score is zero or negligible.
- Manually launch the app multiple times to ensure no visible jumps occur.

## Verification
- To be completed during implementation.

## Files Modified
- To be determined.
