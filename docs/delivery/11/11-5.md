## Requirements
- Verify acceptance criteria across supported platforms.
- Document evidence demonstrating solvable selection and history tagging.
- Report issues to upstream tasks before closing.

## Implementation Plan
1. Prepare scenarios for solvable-only mode including unsolved/solved cycles.
2. Execute on iOS simulator, Android emulator (if available), and web.
3. Capture logs/screens showing dataset entries and history badges.
4. Summarize findings in Verification.

## Test Plan
- Manual: Enable solvable-only mode, start multiple games, and confirm dataset layouts.
- Manual: Solve some games, skip others, verifying selection rotation.
- Manual: Check history entries for solvable badge integration.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`.
- `npx expo export --platform web --output-dir dist-web`.

## Verification
- Attach test notes, logs, and screen captures.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`.
- `npx expo export --platform web --output-dir dist-web`.

## Files Modified
- Documentation / evidence only (no code changes expected).
