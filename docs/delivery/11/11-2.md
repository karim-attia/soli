## Requirements
- Add a toggle in the Settings screen that switches between standard shuffle and solvable-only modes.
- When enabled, new games should load from the dataset prepared in Task 11-1.
- Maintain compatibility with history, undo, and auto-play flows.

## Implementation Plan
1. Extend settings schema with a `solvableOnly` boolean.
2. Update new game generator to choose between random shuffle and dataset-sourced layout.
3. Ensure dataset-driven games still randomize the stock while respecting tableau layout.
4. Provide fallback behavior if dataset is empty.
5. Add tests covering generator selection logic.

## Test Plan
- Manual: Toggle solvable-only mode and start new games, verifying layouts match dataset entries.
- `yarn test --watch=false` for generator logic.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`.

## Verification
- Manual game generation checks on iOS simulator and web.
- `yarn test --watch=false`.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`.

## Files Modified
- `app/settings.tsx`
- `src/solitaire/generator.ts`
- `src/state/settings.ts`
