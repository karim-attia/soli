[Back to task list](../tasks.md)

## Description
Create a data file that stores tableau layouts for known solvable shuffles, omitting stock contents per requirements.

## Requirements
- Store solvable tableau states in a structured file (e.g., JSON) located under `src/data/`.
- Exclude stock configuration; document that stock remains randomized.
- Include metadata such as shuffle ID and difficulty tags if available.

## Implementation Plan
1. Define schema for solvable shuffle entries (e.g., columns + waste + metadata).
2. Populate initial dataset with provided or curated shuffles.
3. Add validation utilities to ensure data integrity.
4. Document process for adding new shuffles (ties into PBI 12).

## Test Plan
- `yarn test --watch=false` for validation utilities.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit` to ensure type safety.
- Manual: Load dataset in development to confirm parsing correctness.

## Verification
- Manual inspection of dataset and validation logs.
- `yarn test --watch=false`.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`.

## Files Modified
- `src/data/solvable-shuffles.json` (new)
- `src/data/README.md` (update)
