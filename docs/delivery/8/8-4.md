[Back to task list](../tasks.md)

## Description
Verify that the new icons and metadata integrate cleanly by running Expo tooling and producing build artifacts suitable for store submission.

## Requirements
- Confirm Expo build/export commands succeed using updated assets and metadata.
- Capture resulting artifact logs for reference.
- Ensure there are no warnings about missing icons or config fields.

## Implementation Plan
1. Run `expo prebuild` or `eas build --local --profile preview` to confirm assets bundle correctly.
2. Execute `expo export` for web to ensure metadata integrates across platforms.
3. Review CLI output for warnings/errors and document resolution steps if any arise.
4. Store log summaries/screenshots in task verification for audit trail.

## Test Plan
- `npx expo prebuild` (dry run).
- `npx expo-doctor` after updates.
- `npx expo export --platform web --output-dir dist-web`.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`.

## Verification
- `npx expo-doctor` → 17/17 checks passed (no schema or dependency warnings).
- `npx expo config --type public` confirmed updated metadata (name, slug, icons, bundle identifiers, release notes).
- `npx expo export --platform web --output-dir dist-web` succeeded after adding `@react-navigation/drawer`; generated artifacts were cleaned up post-check.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit` still surfaces pre-existing Tamagui typing warnings (`app/(tabs)/hello.tsx`, `app/settings.tsx`), unchanged by this task.
- `npx expo prebuild` deferred to release prep to avoid generating native directories in this workspace.

## Files Modified
- `package.json`
- `yarn.lock`
- `src/state/settings.ts`
- `.gitignore`
