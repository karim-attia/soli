## Requirements
- Deliver icons in all resolutions required by Expo (Android, iOS, web).
- Maintain visual consistency across sizes and backgrounds.
- Store source assets (SVG/PSD/etc.) within the repo for future edits.

## Implementation Plan
1. Define the card-on-felt visual motif and pick palette/lighting values.
2. Use a Pillow script to render icon, adaptive foreground, favicon, and splash assets programmatically.
3. Save outputs under `assets/images/` and ensure Expo config references align.
4. Spot-check at multiple scales for legibility.

## Test Plan
- Manual: Inspect generated PNGs for crisp edges and contrast.
- `npx expo export --platform web --output-dir dist-web` (captured under Task 8-4) to verify bundling.
- `npx expo-doctor` (Task 8-4) to confirm config references resolve.

## Verification
- Pillow script regenerated `icon.png`, `adaptive-icon.png`, `favicon.png`, and `splash.png` under `assets/images/`.
- Expo export/build validations documented in Task 8-4 ensured the new assets are bundled.
- Manual checks confirmed the heart card motif reads well on device-scale previews.

## Files Modified
- `assets/images/icon.png`
- `assets/images/adaptive-icon.png`
- `assets/images/favicon.png`
- `assets/images/splash.png`
