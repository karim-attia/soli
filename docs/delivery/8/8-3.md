## Requirements
- Provide step-by-step instructions referencing chosen tools and source files.
- Include date-stamped notes and links to original icon assets.
- Store documentation within the repo (likely `docs/publishing/`).

## Implementation Plan
1. Compile notes from Task 8-1 regarding toolchain and export settings.
2. Create a markdown guide (e.g., `docs/publishing/icon-generation.md`) detailing inputs/outputs.
3. Include screenshots or references to template files where helpful.
4. Review guide for clarity and verify paths remain accurate.

## Test Plan
- Manual: Follow the documented steps to ensure they reproduce the icon set (spot check only).
- `yarn lint docs` (if available) or markdown lint tooling.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit` (sanity).

## Verification
- Cross-check documentation against actual repository structure and assets.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`.

## Files Modified
- `docs/publishing/icon-generation.md` (new)
