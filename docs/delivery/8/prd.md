# PBI-8: Publish readiness assets and metadata

[View in Backlog](../backlog.md#user-content-8)

## Overview
Generate production-quality app icons and complete store metadata so the Solitaire app is ready for submission.

## Problem Statement
The project lacks finalized visual assets and descriptive metadata required by app stores, blocking publication.

## User Stories
- As a maintainer I want publish-ready assets and metadata so that the game can ship to stores.

## Technical Approach
- Use an online icon generation service or custom artwork to produce compliant icon sets across required resolutions.
- Populate app.json / app.config with versioning, description, and related store fields.
- Document the asset generation workflow for repeatability.

## UX/UI Considerations
- Ensure iconography reflects Solitaire themes and reads at small sizes.
- Align metadata language with app branding established by layout updates.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. App icons are generated and applied across required sizes.
2. Store description, versioning, and related metadata are filled in.
3. Documentation captures how assets were generated for future updates.

## Dependencies
- Expo asset pipeline and store submission requirements.

## Open Questions
- Determine whether additional promotional imagery is needed beyond icons.

## Related Tasks
- To be defined in `docs/delivery/8/tasks.md`.
