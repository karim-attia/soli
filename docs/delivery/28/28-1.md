# [28-1] Stop timer when auto-up starts

## Description
Stop the game timer immediately when auto-up (auto-complete) begins, and ensure timer start logic does not restart the timer while auto-up is active.

| 2025-12-14 12:42:00 | Status Change | Agreed | InProgress | Started implementing timer-stop-on-auto-up behavior. | ai_agent |
| 2025-12-14 12:50:00 | Status Change | InProgress | Review | Implemented timer stop on auto-up start and blocked timer restarts during auto-up. | ai_agent |
| 2025-12-14 13:25:00 | Status Change | Review | InProgress | Reopened: timer still running on device; adjust stop logic to use reducer state directly (avoid ref ordering). | ai_agent |
| 2025-12-14 13:35:00 | Status Change | InProgress | Review | Implemented direct timer stop on auto-up start using current state.timerState. | ai_agent |

## Requirements
- When `state.isAutoCompleting` transitions from false → true and the timer is running, dispatch `TIMER_STOP` immediately.
- Prevent the “move count increased” timer-start effect from starting the timer during auto-up.
- Keep behavior unchanged for manual play.

## Implementation Plan
1. Update `useKlondikeTimer` to detect `isAutoCompleting` start and stop the timer.
2. Update timer start-on-move logic to skip starting the timer while auto-up is active.

## Test Plan
- Manual:
  - Start a game, make at least 1 move so the timer runs.
  - Reach a state where auto-up begins; confirm the timer stops immediately and does not restart while auto-up runs.

## Verification
- Manual: When auto-up begins (`isAutoCompleting` flips true), timer is stopped immediately.
- Code: move-count timer-start logic skips starting while `isAutoCompleting` is true.
- Note: Typecheck could not be run in this worktree due to an existing lockfile/workspace mismatch (unrelated to this change).
