[Back to task list](../tasks.md)

## Description
Run an end-to-end validation pass confirming the polished auto-foundation flow satisfies all acceptance criteria.

## Requirements
- Cover animation parity, tableau backfill behavior, and absence of foundation wiggles in test scenarios.
- Document evidence (notes, recordings) for review.
- Report any regressions into earlier tasks before closing.

## Implementation Plan
1. Create a test script that forces auto-play through different board states (with/without tableau moves).
2. Execute on iOS simulator, Android emulator (if available), and web export.
3. Capture timings and note improvements vs prior flow if measurable.
4. Log and reassign issues uncovered during the walkthrough.
5. Summarize findings in the Verification section for stakeholder review.

## Test Plan
- Manual: Auto-complete from a mid-game state ensuring each acceptance criterion is observed.
- Manual: Re-run with solvable shuffle to confirm deterministic behavior.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`.
- `npx expo export --platform web --output-dir dist-web`.

## Verification
- Attach walkthrough notes and relevant recordings.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit`.
- `npx expo export --platform web --output-dir dist-web`.

## Files Modified
- Documentation / evidence only (no code changes expected).
