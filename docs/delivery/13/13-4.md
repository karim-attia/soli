# [13-4] E2E CoS test: resume saved game

[Back to task list](../tasks.md)

## Description
Validate the acceptance criteria end-to-end by confirming that an in-progress game persists, restores, and handles corrupted data scenarios as expected.

## Requirements
- Cover the CoS scenarios defined in `docs/delivery/13/prd.md`.
- Provide reproducible manual or automated steps for QA to follow.
- Document expected UI signals (e.g., toast on corruption) and attach evidence once executed.

## Implementation Plan
1. Draft a test script enumerating each acceptance criterion.
2. Decide whether to automate via Detox/Playwright or keep as a manual runbook for now.
3. Capture results (screenshots/logs) and note any discrepancies.

## Test Plan
- Execute the documented E2E script on iOS simulator, Android emulator, and web build.

## Verification
- Track completion evidence in the task file once run.
