# [14-3] Refine foundation feedback handling

[Back to task list](../tasks.md)

## Description
Adjust foundation interaction logic so automated move sequences never trigger invalid-move wiggles, while manual taps still provide the expected feedback.

## Requirements
- Distinguish automation-triggered interactions from user gestures at the controller level.
- Ensure wiggle animations (and any sound effects) only fire for manual invalid taps.
- Provide dev tooling to confirm suppression decisions when diagnosing bugs.

## Implementation Plan
1. Extend the flight controller or interaction layer with explicit context for automation vs manual sources.
2. Update foundation components to consult this context before triggering feedback.
3. Add temporary logging or UI indicators that reveal when feedback is suppressed.

## Test Plan
- Manual: Run auto-complete and confirm no foundation wiggles occur.
- Manual: Tap foundation piles manually to verify wiggle still fires on invalid moves.
- Automated (if feasible): Simulation covering both scenarios.

## Verification
- Attach before/after recordings and log excerpts demonstrating the new behavior prior to Review.

## Files Modified
- Foundation interaction components and flight controller feedback hooks.
