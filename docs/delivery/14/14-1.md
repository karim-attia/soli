# [14-1] Audit current flight measurement workflow

[Back to task list](../tasks.md)

## Description
Catalogue all code paths that trigger flight animations, record when snapshots are taken, and identify race conditions causing missing animations or unintended wiggles.

## Requirements
- Enumerate every dispatch path (`APPLY_MOVE`, `PLACE_ON_*`, auto-queue) and their snapshot timing.
- Capture known scenarios where animations fail or wiggles occur, including reproducible steps.
- Provide a gap analysis feeding into the refactoring tasks.

## Implementation Plan
1. Instrument current code with temporary logging to trace snapshot readiness and dispatch order.
2. Document findings in a shared report covering manual moves, auto-complete, undo, and celebrations.
3. Summarize root causes and constraints that the new controller must respect.

## Test Plan
- Manual: Reproduce known missing-flight scenarios and gather logs.
- Manual: Validate findings across both simulator and physical device if available.

## Verification
- Attach audit report and log excerpts to this task before moving to Review.

## Files Modified
- Documentation only (analysis report referenced in Verification).
